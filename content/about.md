Previously, I've worked on digital products at [**Sony Interactive Entertainment**](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/corporate/about/) and at [**Ponder**](http://pndr.co/). I have also taught web design and development as a teaching assistant at the [**USC Viterbi School of Engineering**](http://viterbi.usc.edu/). Currently, I'm leading a small product team to build out [**TechLA**](http://tech.la/), an internships platform for LA startups backed by [**Upfront Ventures**](http://upfront.com/).

When I'm not designing, brewing a pour-over coffee, or exploring restaurants in LA, I can be found playing shows in the city with [**Bazaar Ensemble**](http://bazaarensemble.bandcamp.com/releases). I write and perform original music, some of which you can find on my [**SoundCloud**](https://soundcloud.com/stephenchenmusic/sets/my-recordings). I also think that [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/scdevy/) is a ton of fun.

Want to say hi? Get in touch at [**hello@stephenc.me**](mailto:hello@stephenc.me) or send me a [**tweet**](https://twitter.com/SCDevy)! I'm also available for freelance work.
