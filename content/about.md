At USC I cofounded **<a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoSparkSC" target="_blank">Spark SC</a>** – we connect and empower passionate student entrepreneurs and makers on campus through initiatives like <a href="http://sparksc.org/events/1000-pitches.html" target="_blank">1000 Pitches</a> and <a href="http://sparksc.org/events/startup-career-fair.html" target="_blank">Startup Career Fair</a>. I also helped found **<a href="https://www.facebook.com/USCHackers/" target="_blank">USC Hackers</a>**, where I directed branding and design and organized weekly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/uschacknights/" target="_blank">Hack Nights</a>. I &hearts; teaching, and I've mentored and led workshops on both design and web development as an instructor at **<a href="http://hacksc.com/" target="_blank">HackSC</a>** and as a teaching assistant at the **<a href="http://viterbi.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC Viterbi School of Engineering</a>**.

Previously, I've worked at **<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/corporate/about/" target="_blank">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>** and at **<a href="http://pndr.co/" target="_blank">Ponder</a>**, designing and building digital products. Currently, I'm leading a small product team to launch **<a href="http://tech.la/" target="_blank">TechLA</a>**, an internships platform for Los Angeles startups backed by **<a href="http://upfront.com/" target="_blank">Upfront Ventures</a>**.

When I'm not designing, coding, or experimenting with pourover coffee, I can sometimes be found playing shows in the city with **<a href="http://bazaarensemble.bandcamp.com/releases" target="_blank">Bazaar Ensemble</a>** on saxophone. I write and perform original music, some of which you can find on my **<a href="https://soundcloud.com/stephenchenmusic/sets/my-recordings" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>**. I take photos – my client work can be found **<a href="https://www.facebook.com/stephenchenphotography/" target="_blank">here</a>** and I occasionally chronicle my own adventures over on **<a href="https://www.instagram.com/scdevy/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>**.
