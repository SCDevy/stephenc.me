Previously, I've worked at [**Sony Interactive Entertainment**](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/corporate/about/) and at [**Ponder**](http://pndr.co/), designing and building digital products. Currently, I'm leading a small product team to launch [**TechLA**](http://tech.la/), an internships platform for Los Angeles startups backed by [**Upfront Ventures**](http://upfront.com/).

At USC I cofounded [**Spark SC**](https://www.facebook.com/GoSparkSC) – we believe in connecting and empowering passionate student entrepreneurs and makers on campus, through initiatives like [1000 Pitches](http://sparksc.org/events/1000-pitches.html) and [Startup Career Fair](http://sparksc.org/events/startup-career-fair.html). I also helped found [**USC Hackers**](https://www.facebook.com/USCHackers/), where I directed branding and design and organized weekly [Hack Nights](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uschacknights/). I really enjoy teaching, and I've mentored and led workshops on design and web development as an instructor at [**HackSC**](http://hacksc.com/) and as a teaching assistant at the [**USC Viterbi School of Engineering**](http://viterbi.usc.edu/).

When I'm not designing, coding, or experimenting with pourover coffee, I can sometimes be found playing shows in the city with [**Bazaar Ensemble**](http://bazaarensemble.bandcamp.com/releases). I write and perform original music, some of which you can find on my [**SoundCloud**](https://soundcloud.com/stephenchenmusic/sets/my-recordings). I &hearts; photography – I showcase my client work [**here**](https://www.facebook.com/stephenchenphotography/) and occasionally chronicle my adventures over on [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/scdevy/).
